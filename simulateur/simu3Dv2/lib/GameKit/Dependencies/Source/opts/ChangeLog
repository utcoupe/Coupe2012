0.1:	Initial draft.
0.2:	Added multiple-arg opts, various cleanup.
0.3:	Standardized API a bit, massive cleanup.
0.4:	Fixed yet another off-by-one error in moving optsind around.
0.5:	Fixed copyright, which mysteriously claimed Xerox owned this code.
	(Probably because I imported a template from some code I wrote for
	Xerox.)  And *finally* fixed the !@#@# optsind bug.  As always,
	when you find yourself struggling to get the side effects of an
	operation right, the operation is in the wrong place.
0.6:	s/tf/ft/ in optlib.3, started using man2html.  Added BSD licensing.
0.7:	The massive rewrite, of course, introduced a subtle bug; '--' would
	leave it such that argv[optsind] was the '--', which is supposed to
	be eaten.  Hadn't tested that.  *sigh*.
0.8:	And another subtle bug; the semantics of options which have no
	values (especially those created by optsmake()) were such that
	they would attempt to free random things (like previous integer
	options) as though they were pointers.  I *think* this is fixed.
	Note that optsopt() will leak a small amount of memory, though
	never (I hope!) more than two allocations at a time; it allocates
	a small amount of storage, but frees it if it needs to allocate
	more.
0.9:	Minor changes.  Should be better at handling multiple passes through
	multiple argument lists.
	Moved history from README into ChangeLog.
	Removed "optsver", deprecated in favor of the version stuff.
0.9.1:	Renamed "optlib" to "opts" and sanitized Makefile.
	Removed optsver from man page.
0.9.2:  --foo options with arguments were trying to grab the word after
	their argument, not their argument.  Fixed, I hope.
	Updated copyright info, date in man page, and email address
0.9.3	invalid short options caused optsgets() to loop forevere.
0.9.4	optsfind could strncmp against NULL on nameless options (which
	are implicitly never matched by --name options, now)
0.9.5	POSIX mode added, argument getting broken out into separate function.
0.9.6	Fixed bug if ptrdiff_t is long, and long is longer than int.
	Updated readme.
0.9.7	After returning '?' once, optsopt will start returning -1.
0.9.8	Licensing change (remove GPL)
0.9.9	Add is_set feature
	Correct off-by-one error in list of option types ("buffer" wasn't
	in the list)
	Clean up handling of OTYPE_BUF a little.
	Add optscheck() call to optsget() and optsgets()
0.9.10	Don't check for missing value on OTYPE_ARG, which has sub-arguments
        to hold its values.
	Fix missing argument to error().
