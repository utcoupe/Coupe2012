		Each InstanceManager can control one technique and one mesh, but it can manage
		multiple materials at the same time.
		@See SceneManager::createInstanceManager, which creates this InstanceManager. Each one
		must have a unique name. It's wasteless to create two InstanceManagers with the same
		mesh reference, instancing technique and instances per batch count.
		This class takes care of managing batches automatically, so that more are created when
		needed, and reuse existing ones as much as posible; thus the user doesn't have to worry
		of managing all those low level issues.
		@See InstanceBatch & @see InstanceEntity for more information.
