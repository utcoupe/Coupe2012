	/** Instancing implementation using vertex texture through Vertex Texture Fetch (VTF)
		This implementation has the following advantages:
		  * Supports huge ammount of instances per batch
		  * Supports skinning even with huge ammounts of instances per batch
		  * Doesn't need shader constants registers.
		  * Best suited for skinned entities

		But beware the disadvantages:
		  * VTF is only fast on modern GPUs (ATI Radeon HD 2000+, GeForce 8+ series onwards)
		  * On GeForce 6/7 series VTF is too slow
		  * VTF isn't (controversely) supported on old ATI X1800 hardware
		  * Only one bone weight per vertex is supported
		  * GPUs with low memory bandwidth (i.e. laptops and integrated GPUs)
		  may perform even worse than no instancing

		Whether this performs great or bad depends on the hardware. It improved up to 4x performance on
		a Intel Core 2 Quad Core X9650 GeForce 8600 GTS, and in an Intel Core 2 Duo P7350 ATI
		Mobility Radeon HD 4650, but went 0.75x slower on an AthlonX2 5000+ integrated nForce 6150 SE
		Each BaseInstanceBatchVTF has it's own texture, which occupies memory in VRAM.
		Approx VRAM usage can be computed by doing 12 bytes * 3 * numInstances * numBones
		Use flag IM_VTFBESTFIT to avoid wasting VRAM (but may reduce ammount of instances per batch).
		@par
		The material requires at least a texture unit stage named "InstancingVTF"
