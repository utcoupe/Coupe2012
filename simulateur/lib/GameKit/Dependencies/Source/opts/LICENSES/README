These licenses are borrowed from various sources.  The Artistic license is a
slightly modified version of the Perl license.  The BSD license is a very
slightly modified version of the license associated with BSD 4.4.

The changes to the Artistic license only remove references to such things as
embedding the interpreter for "this language" in other programs, and other
things that apply well to Perl, but not to my software.  The BSD license
changes reflect the subtle differences between me and the Regents of the
University of California, Berkeley.
