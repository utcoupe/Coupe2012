 *
 *  Some notes for people familiar with the nuts and bolts of PID control:
 *  - I used the Ideal form of the PID equation.  mainly because I like IMC
 *    tunings.  lock in the I and D, and then just vary P to get more 
 *    aggressive or conservative
 *
 *  - While this controller presented to the outside world as being a Reset Time
 *    controller, when the user enters their tunings the I term is converted to
 *    Reset Rate.  I did this merely to avoid the div0 error when the user wants
 *    to turn Integral action off.
 *    
 *  - Derivative on Measurement is being used instead of Derivative on Error.  The
 *    performance is identical, with one notable exception.  DonE causes a kick in
 *    the controller output whenever there's a setpoint change. DonM does not.
 *
 *  If none of the above made sense to you, and you would like it to, go to:
 *  http://www.controlguru.com .  Dr. Cooper was my controls professor, and is
 *  gifted at concisely and clearly explaining PID control
